I looked at who’s buying bikes and what factors seem to matter most. Here’s what I found:

Income and Bike Purchases

(1) People who bought a bike tend to earn a bit more on average than those who didn’t.

(2) Among women, bike buyers make about $55,300 per year versus $53,400 for non-buyers.

(3) Among men, bike buyers make about $59,600 per year versus $56,500 for non-buyers.

Age Groups and Buying Patterns

(1) Middle-aged customers are the biggest group, with around 400 purchases.

(2) Younger (adolescent) and older customers buy fewer bikes (under 100 each), and non-buyers still outnumber buyers in those two groups.

Commute Distance and Purchases

(1) People with very short commutes (0–1 mile) buy the most bikes (over 200 purchases).

(2) As commute distance increases to 1–2 miles, purchases drop sharply and stay low.

(3) After about 5 miles, non-buyers begin to outnumber buyers more noticeably.

Key Takeaways

(1) Higher income, especially among men, is linked to purchasing a bike.

(2) Middle-aged riders make up the core customer base.

(3) Shorter commutes drive the highest purchase rates. People are most likely to buy a bike when it makes daily travel easy.
